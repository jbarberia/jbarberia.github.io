* **Application of Signal Classifiers in Auditory Evoked Potentials for the Detection of Pathological Patients**

    The auditory brainstem response (ABR) by evoked potentials is a widespread auditory pathway assessment technique. This is largely applied due to its cost-effectiveness, practicality and ease of use. In contrast, it requires a trained professional to carry out the analysis of the results. This motivates several research efforts to increase the independence of the diagnostician. To this end, the present work shows the ability of three signal classification tools to differentiate ABR studies of normal hearing subjects from those who may have some pathology. As a starting point, the PhysioNet short term auditory evoked potentials databases are used to calculate the features later applied to construct the dataset. The features used are diverse classes of permutation entropy, fractal dimension, the Lyapunov exponent and the zero crossing rate. To ensure more accurate results, a Montecarlo simulation of one thousand trials is employed to train the classifiers and test the results. The goodness of the classification is performed upon the basis of the computation of quality parameters, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), the F1 score coefficient and the accuracy. In all the cases the methodology proposed gives high performance results that encourage the line of research of the present work.

* **Benchmarking of open-source software for the optimal power flow problem**

    In this work, a comparative study was made of the different open-source alternatives that currently exist for the modeling, simulation and optimization of electrical power systems. In this case, the PowerModels, Matpower and PFNET libraries were evaluated, the three developed on different programming languages, on the PGLIB database.
    
    The solvers and parameters selected in each library were described, detailing the results obtained for each solved case and for each proposed alternative. Based on this, resolution times and deviations from the PGLIB baseline were analyzed

* **Computational Tool for Optimal Expansion of Transmission Networks**

    This paper presents a software tool with a graphical user interface for transmission system expansion planning. Trough an integer-mixed optimization algorithm this tool selects the best combination of projects in all the given scenarios. In this model the load shed control policy to avoid overloads in the circuits is considered. Finally, a case study of the Argentinean interconnection system is presented to illustrate the use of the transmission planning software in real power system models.

* **Application of entropic measures in the study of auditory evoked potentials for the detection of pathological patients**

    The aim of the present work was to design an algorithm to increase the objectivity in differentiating the records of short-latency of auditory evoked potentials between subjects with normal hearing and those with pathologies in the auditory pathway. For this purpose, traditional permutation entropy, weighted permutation entropy and a modified version of the original permutation entropy published in the most recent literature were used to achieve this objective. The choice of the most appropriate entropy was made based on the calculation of the specificity, sensibility, precision and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results obtained showed that for the differentiation of healthy and pathological records in the case of minors, the weighted permutation entropy was more appropriate and the modified version in the case of adults.

* **Evaluation of the performance of permutation entropy variants for classifying auditory evoked potentials**

    The aim of the present work was to investigate the performance of entropic tools to classify, subjects with normal hearing and those with pathologies in the auditory pathway, using short-latency records of auditory evoked potentials. To accomplish with this objective, traditional permutation entropy, weighted permutation entropy and a modified version of the original permutation entropy, correcting the count of the missing or forbidden patterns.

    The database used consisted of two age groups, one of minors aged from a few months to four years and the other of older aged over 18 years.

    For both minor and older subjects, thirty samples were randomly selected from both normal and hearing-impaired subjects.

    Once the different varieties of entropy had been calculated, the difference in mean values was analyzed using statistical tests to check whether the difference between them was significant or not. The differences between means of the groups with and without pathology were found to be significantly different at a level of 99.9 %.

    Finally, the choice of the most appropriate entropy was made based on the calculation of the specificity, selectivity, precision and area under the operation reception curve. The results obtained showed that for the differentiation of healthy and pathological records in the case of minors, the weighted permutation entropy was more appropriate and the modified version of the permutation in the case of older adults.
